# Sudoku

A solver for the classic puzzle, as a programming project for CIS 211 at University of Oregon. 

The project will have two phases.  In the first phase we implement constraint propagation to solve simple puzzles.  In the second phase we will add back-tracking search to solve harder puzzles. 

We will use a model-view-controller organization to associate a graphical display with the game. 

Several modules and example initial puzzles are provided. You will be implementing several classes in the `sdk_board.py` module. You do not have to modify any of the other provided modules.

A 'Sudoku' debug configuration for VS Code is also included (Debug icon in left menu).
If you prefer the Coding Rooms IDE, simply click on the CR2 button in the upper right corner.
